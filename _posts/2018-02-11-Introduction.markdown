I've wanted a blog for a while, but been at a loss as to what to write about. I read an excellent suggestion to simply write the articles you wish you'd found whenever you have to search for something; the idea is that if you're looking for some information and can't find it then presumably someone else is too, so there's value in documenting it!

In time I'm sure it'll contain short essays and rants about technology as well.

Cheers,
Ian
