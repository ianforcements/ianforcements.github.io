My name is Ian, I'm a technologist of the sort who believes that web servers don't belong in light globes. My tech interests are chiefly application security and reversing. My non-tech interests include visual art, live theatre and cocktails. üç∏

I write mainly about technology things, and in particular I write articles that I wish I had found whenever I have to search for something; the idea is that if I'm looking for some information and can't find it then presumably someone else is too, so there's value in documenting it!

On occasion I write short essays and rants as well.

This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages, and is built using Jekyll with the [Minimal-Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme with some slight adjustments.
