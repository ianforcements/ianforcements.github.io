My name is Ian, I'm a technologist of the sort who believes that web servers don't belong in light globes. My tech interests are security, networks and schadenfreude. My non-tech interests are visual art, live theatre and cocktails. üç∏

I write mainly about technology things, and in particular I write articles that I wish I had found whenever I have to search for something; the idea is that if I'm looking for some information and can't find it then presumably someone else is too, so there's value in documenting it!

On occasion I write short essays and rants as well.
